                            Casey Luong is a vietnamese-american singer from Sugar Land, Texas known by his artist name Keshi. Keshi is a nickname he recieved from his fiance's parents who had trouble pronouncing his name Casey. Keshi is currently engaged to his childhood friend Mai who he writes about in his hit song "Understand" where he asked her to marry him. He makes pop and R&B music and often uses friends relationships as inspiration for his music. His greatest inspirations in music is John Mayer.

                            Keshi originally worked a registered nurse after earning his bachelor's in nursing from the Univeristy of Texas at Austin. However he had always had a draw to music, and growing up, he could always be seen with a guitar in hand. Keshi returns to his Texas roots and reflects on gorwing up to fast in his hit song "Texas" off of his newest album Requiem.
                            While making music on the side as a hobby the success of his EP "The Reaper" and specifically his song "2 soon" landed him a record deal with Island Records, a label under Universal Music Group. This led Keshi to leave behind nursing to follow his dream of becoming a singer.

                            After signing to the label keshi would go on to release 3 more EPs known as the trilogy EPs, which include the "Skeletons" EP, "Bandaids" EP, and Always" EP, before putting his efforts into making an album. He would also see immense success with his single "Beside you" during this time. In 2022, Keshi finally released his debut album "Gabriel" which he described as something he thought he would never be able to do. In the album Keshi reflects on his newfound stardom and his relationship with his fiance. The two biggest hits from the album would be "Limbo", which he would play on the night show with Stephen Collbert, and "Understand." This album would spark two world tours where he would describe his song "ANGEL" as his favorite part of the set to play.

                            In 2023 despite the success of the tours Keshi would release no new music. Personally he was struggling with the death of one of his friends and early supporters Sebastian Sdaigui. In 2024 Keshi put these struggles to song on his newest album Requiem where he reflects on his life after turning 30 this year and the untimely passing of his friend. His song "Just to Die" is Keshi's only song on the album completely produced and written by himself where he talks about how fleeting life is. His song "Soft Spot" off of his new album has gone on to recieve massive success so far. He will begin the Requiem world tour early next year during which he will play his dream venue Madison Square Gardens which he sang about in his song "More" on the "Always" EP where he said  "Dying to see you in a dream that I had, where I sing in arenas." Keshi said that Requiem is his vision of what an album that should be played in a arena means.
